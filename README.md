# Face_Smile_Detection

This project explores basic functionality of <a href = "https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python"> opencv-python </a>

## Provided Classes 

The classes present in the project use a basic Haar cascade classifier for face and smile detection, provided already trained from opencv. These include : 

*  [FaceDetectorHaar](Face_Detector.py)
*  [SmileDetectorHaar](Smile_Detector.py)
*  [FaceSmileDetectorHaar](Face_Smile_Detector.py)

These classes act as a convienent wrapper for instantiating instances of each detector and combining them in [FaceSmileDetectorHaar](Face_Smile_Detector.py). 

## Dependencies

### opencv-python

opencv-python can be installed easily following the provided [documentation](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python). Usually a simple : 

```pip install opencv-python```

is all it takes. 

### NumPy

NumPy can be installed using the provided [documentation](https://numpy.org/install/). Usually a simple :

```pip install numpy```

is all it takes. 



## Usage
